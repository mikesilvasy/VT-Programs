Compulsory (Cold) - A compulsory miss will occur upon starting a program.  This miss is inevitable because data cannot be placed in
                    the cache before traveling through the memory heirarchy.

Conflict - A conflict miss will occur when two blocks map to the same block of memory.  Since only one block can take up that space, the
           other block cannot be place in the cache.

Capacity - A capacity miss will occur when the cache is smaller than a program's available blocks/pages (finite cache size).  Since the
           cache is not of infinite size, some blocks of memory are removed and brought back at a later time.
