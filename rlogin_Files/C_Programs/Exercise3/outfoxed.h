/*
 * The game "OutFoxed" by GameWright (http://bit.ly/1QWKDzD)
 * is a cooperative deduction style game for children 5 years or older.
 *
 * In the game, a thief stole Mrs. Plumpert's prized pot pie and 4 chicken detectives 
 * must crack the case.  They do this by gathering clues that can eliminate suspects.
 * Each suspect owns 3 clues.  For instance, suspect 'Mary' wears a
 * flower, a scarf, and carries a briefcase.
 *
 * For each round of play, the thief is chosen by drawing a random card face down 
 * and placing it into a plastic decoder device onto which clues are placed.
 * The name of thief is not visible when the thief card is placed in the decoder.
 * When a clue is placed onto the decoder and the decoder is opened, it will reveal 
 * a color for this clue (red or green).  Players will see only this color and
 * must deduce which suspect(s) could match the clue.
