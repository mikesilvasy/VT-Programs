RULES OF TIC-TAC-TOE

1) The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2) There are 2 players; the first player is X and the second player is O.
   Players take turns putting their pieces in empty squares.
3) The first player to get 3 of their pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) is the winner.
4) When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
   If no player has 3 pieces in a row, the game is over and the result is a draw.
